# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This project currently contains no substantive documentation or code. The `README.md` is empty, and no project-specific conventions, workflows, or architectural patterns are discoverable at this time.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If you are initializing this project, prompt the user to provide a project description, intended tech stack, and any preferred conventions.
- When adding files, follow standard conventions for the chosen language/framework until project-specific patterns emerge.
- If you discover new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions as the project evolves, update this file to document them for future agents.

## Next Steps
- Ask the user for project goals, requirements, or any initial setup instructions.
- Once code or documentation is added, analyze the new content and update these instructions accordingly.

_This file will be updated as the project develops. For now, follow best practices for new project bootstrapping._
